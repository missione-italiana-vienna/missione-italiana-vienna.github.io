# Repository for the website of the Italian Catholic Mission in Vienna

This is the GitHub repository for the website of the Italian Catholic Mission in Vienna.

## Details on the repository

The website of the Italian Catholic Mission in Vienna (Missione Cattolica Italiana dell'Arcidiocesi di Vienna) runs using GitHub Pages (at the host [https://missione-italiana-vienna.github.io](https://missione-italiana-vienna.github.io)).

Per default GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to create webpages. This creates problems with files other that index.html (in particular, it does not allow to use a robots.txt file; moreover it results in a 404 error for every html file other than the index.html of the corresponding folder). Since we don't need to use Jekyll, the simplest solution is to disable it by having an empty file named .nojekyll in the main folder of the repository.

In other terms, we currently use GitHub Pages basically only as a hosting server, without using any of the other functionalities provided by GitHub Pages via Jekyll.
